Version 1.1 from http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-super-cache/installation/

Installed for performance and reduced latency.

Installed network wide.

Configured to use php-based caching since it is a little simple to configure.

Has some explicit custom settings in puppet to set up a cache directory and provide the cache config.
