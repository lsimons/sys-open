Version 0.5.4.2 from http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wordpress-mu-domain-mapping/installation/

Installed to allow any site on wordpress to get a custom domain name.

Has some explicit custom settings in puppet to install sunrise.php.

Configure the domain to point at the right site from the network admin.

Add a CNAME from <yourdomainname> to wp.example.org. to get the site served.

Note *.example.com is already CNAMED. So if you want to point foo.example.com to foo.wp.example.org, you don't need to touch the DNS.

You can edit systems.yml to set ServerAlias to even more completely hide where the site is hosted.
