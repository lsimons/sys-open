In your systems.yml, place something EXACTLY like this:

  classes:
    davfs:
      mountpoints:
        cloudbees-kernel:
          url: https://99aldf.nl/a993/lkdfhj/kernel
          user: someuser
          pass: RandomPass
        cloudbees-kernel-devel:
          url: https://some-other-url.com/kernel/devel
          user: someuser-devel
          pass: RandomDevPass

ISSUES

We would rather use dictionaries for easy and consistent lookups. However, this
is not possible as we need the information in those arrays to also be made
available to 'create_resources' (in manifests/init.pp). And 'create_resources'
can only handle arrays.

So. We will convert some hashes to dictionaries. On the fly.

First fetch the hashes:
--------------------------%>
<% scope.lookupvar("davfs::mountpoints").to_hash.each do |mountpoint| %>

<%# ------------------------
Very neatly converting a hash into a dict. 
Puppet. Hate. Hate. Hate. 
--------------------------%>
<% mountpoint[1].map { |i| [i[0], i[1]] } %> 

<%# Call values using the dict. Yay.%>
<%= mountpoint[1]['url'] %> <%= mountpoint[1]['user'] %> "<%= mountpoint[1]['pass'] %>"
<% end %>
