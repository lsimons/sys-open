# A list of addresses that are allowed to connect.  This must be a
# regular expression, since Net::Server does not understand CIDR-style
# network notation unless the perl module Net::CIDR is installed.  You
# may repeat the allow line as many times as you'd like

allow ^127\.0\.0\.1$

# If you have installed the Net::CIDR perl module, you can use one or more
# cidr_allow and cidr_deny address/mask patterns.  A connecting client must
# match any cidr_allow, and not match any cidr_deny.  Note that a netmask
# *must* be provided, even if it's /32
#
# Example:
#
# cidr_allow 127.0.0.1/32
# cidr_allow 192.0.2.0/24
# cidr_deny  192.0.2.42/32

cidr_allow <%= monitorhost %>/32
<% if defined? ipaddress_eth1 %>
  <% if profile == "monitorhost" %>
      # Allowing myself access from my own secundary address.
      cidr_allow <%= ipaddress_eth1 %>/32
  <% end %>
<% end %>

# Which address to bind to;
